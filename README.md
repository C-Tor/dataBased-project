Setting up workflow:
1. Make a clone of this repository on the OSU engr stak folder. Or you could just copy and paste the repository into the stak folder whenever you want to run/test it, but I think it's better to just keep the stak connection open whenever working.
2. Open a bash to this directory, then do the command "npm install" to install all the depencencies for the project (express, handlebars, mysql)
3. Modify the contents in the dbcon_example.js file to match your database username and password, then change the filename to just "dbcon.js". This is in .gitignore so it won't be pushed to the github, I think this is more secure?
4.
